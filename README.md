### MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR IMPACT MONITORING AND LOCALIZATION ON METALLIC PLATES USING  FIBER BRAGG GRATING SENSORS 

Abstract: â€”Monitoring the location of position is a vital part of structural health monitoring. Such approaches usually involve monitoring the stress waves produced by the impact. Fiber Bragg grating sensors are useful for this task as they are robust, compact and resistant to electromagnetic interference. In this work, a grating sensor is bonded to an aluminum sheet, and ball bearings are dropped at different locations to simulate impacts on the structure. Time and frequency domain analysis were used to examine the signals acquired during the impact. Machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and Ensemble Learning have been explored for  identifying the impact location. The best accuracy of 87.78%  was achieved for ensemble learning with 5-fold cross validation.
